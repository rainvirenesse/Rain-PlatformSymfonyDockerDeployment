# Final Project Deployment Guide

## Symfony Docker Deployment (Railway & Other Hosting Platforms)

This project demonstrates how to containerize and deploy a Symfony application using Docker and related technologies.

---

## Technologies Used

The application is deployed using:

- Docker
- Nginx
- PHP-FPM
- MySQL
- Docker Compose

---

## Project Objectives

This project is designed to demonstrate understanding of:

- Containerized application deployment
- Symfony production configuration
- Docker networking and orchestration
- Web server configuration using Nginx
- Environment variable management
- Cloud deployment workflows (e.g., Railway)

---

## Project Requirements

Your final project must include:

- A working Symfony application
- Dockerized deployment setup
- Proper Nginx configuration
- Production-ready environment configuration
- Database integration
- Complete deployment documentation
- Successful deployment on a hosting platform (e.g., Railway)

---

## Required Files

Create the following files in your project root directory:

### Dockerfile

Defines the blueprint for building the application’s Docker image.  
Without it, the application cannot be containerized or deployed consistently across environments.

---

### docker-compose.yaml

Defines and manages multiple containers as a single application stack (primarily for local development).  
Ensures all services work together as a complete system and simplifies container orchestration.

---

### entrypoint.sh

Script executed when a container starts.  
Ensures the application initializes in a consistent and production-ready state every time.

---

### nginx.conf

Main configuration file for the Nginx web server.  
Acts as the entry point for all web traffic and forwards requests correctly to the application.

---

### nginx-main.conf

Additional or environment-specific Nginx configuration file.  
Improves maintainability and allows safer updates without modifying the main config.

---

### .dockerignore

Specifies files and folders excluded from the Docker build context.  
Helps keep Docker images clean and builds efficient.

---

### .env

Stores environment variables used by the application.  
Keeps sensitive information out of the codebase and allows flexible configuration across environments.

---

## Deployment Notes

- Ensure all environment variables are properly set before deployment
- Verify database connection settings in `.env`
- Use production mode for Symfony in deployment
- Confirm Nginx is correctly routing requests to PHP-FPM
- Test Docker Compose setup locally before deploying

---

## Deployment Platform

Recommended platform:

- Railway

## Notes

This project is intended for educational purposes and demonstrates full-stack containerized deployment practices using Symfony.

## What to submit

    - Explanation of the Nginx configuration (1–2 mins)
    - Environment variable setup overview (1 min)
    - Deployment process walkthrough (2–3 mins)
    - Final proof that the deployed version is working correctly (1–2 mins)
